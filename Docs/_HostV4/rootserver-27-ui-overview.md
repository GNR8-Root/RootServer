# UI Overview

---

RootServer's UI architecture consists of three main contexts:

1. **`_Sites`** - Public-facing website with section-based rendering
2. **`_Editor`** - Internal editor environment for runtime inspection
3. **`_Core`** - Foundation components used by both

All three follow layered composition principles with reusable patterns.
