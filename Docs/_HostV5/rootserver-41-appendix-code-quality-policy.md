# Code Quality Policy

---

## Code Quality Principles

### Readability First
Code should be easy to understand and maintain. Clarity over cleverness.

### Single Responsibility
Components and methods should do one thing well.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Extract common patterns into reusable utilities.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Don't build features until they're needed.

## Quality Indicators

### Positive Signals
- Clear, descriptive names
- Short, focused methods
- Minimal dependencies
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logical component structure

### Warning Signs
- Long methods (>50 lines)
- Deep nesting (>3 levels)
- Many parameters (>5)
- Tight coupling
- Duplicated code

## Review Process

Code quality is assessed through:
- Peer review
- Architectural review
- Manual inspection
- Developer discussion

---

## Refactoring

When to refactor:
- Adding new features to unclear code
- Finding duplicated patterns
- Performance issues
- Security concerns
