# Node Editor Vision

---

## Purpose

The Node Editor is a visual, schema-driven system for defining application behavior, structure, and AI workflows without hardcoding logic.

It acts as a **unified orchestration layer** that connects:
- Airtable data models
- Azure Foundry AI capabilities
- Layout and structure generators
- Runtime execution logic

The editor produces **executable blueprints**, not UI mockups or code fragments.

---

## Core Principles

- Declarative over imperative
- Structure before styling
- Data- and schema-first design
- AI as a first-class participant
- Runtime execution from immutable graphs

---

## What the Node Editor Is

- A graph-based definition system
- A composition tool for logic, data, and AI
- A structure generator, not a page builder
- A bridge between content, AI, and runtime

---

## What the Node Editor Is Not

- A low-level code editor
- A visual programming language replacement
- A real-time collaboration tool (initially)
- A styling or design system

---

## High-Level Capabilities

- Visual orchestration of Airtable data flows
- AI-assisted structure and content generation
- Deterministic + probabilistic execution paths
- Runtime-safe validation before execution
- Reusable and versionable graph definitions

---

## Long-Term Vision

The Node Editor becomes the **single source of truth** for:
- Application structure
- AI decision flows
- Data-driven UI generation
- Content orchestration

Code becomes the execution engine - graphs become the intent.
