# Base Layer

This section defines the **conceptual foundation** of the Node Editor.
It explains the vision, terminology, core abstractions, and data models
without assuming a specific runtime, framework, or execution engine.

- **[Base Vision](node-editor-01-base-vision.md)**  
  High-level goals, non-goals, and guiding principles of the Node Editor.

- **[Base Concepts](node-editor-02-base-concepts.md)**  
  Core terminology such as graphs, nodes, edges, ports, and flows.

- **[Base Nodes](node-editor-03-base-basenodes.md)**  
  Fundamental node categories and shared properties across all node types.

- **[Base Node Types](node-editor-04-base-nodetypes.md)**  
  Formal definition of node kinds (root, composite, decorator, leaf, etc.).

- **[Base Structure Generator](node-editor-05-base-structure-generator.md)**  
  Rules and helpers for generating valid graph structures programmatically.

- **[Base Execution Model](node-editor-06-base-execution.md)**  
  Conceptual execution semantics, node states, and lifecycle (non-runtime).

- **[Base Flow Types](node-editor-07-base-flow-type.md)**  
  Definition of flow semantics and flow-specific constraints.

- **[Base Foundry / Airtable Integration](node-editor-08-base-foundry-airtable.md)**  
  How external schema systems (e.g. Airtable) map onto node editor concepts.

- **[Base Examples](node-editor-09-base-examples.md)**  
  Illustrative examples of graphs, nodes, and editor usage.

- **[Base Synchronization](node-editor-10-base-sync.md)**  
  Conceptual model for snapshots, patches, conflicts, and versioning.

- **[Base Schema](node-editor-11-base-schema.md)**  
  Canonical schema definitions and invariants for graphs, nodes, and edges.
