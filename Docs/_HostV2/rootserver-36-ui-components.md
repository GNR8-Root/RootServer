# Components

Reusable composed UI building blocks and rules for keeping them maintainable.

---
## Component composition

Components are composed building blocks, often made of Displays/Fields/Pointers/Actions.

Evidence:
- `Shared/_Core/06_Components/`
- `Shared/_Editor/06_Components/`


## Reusability rules

- Keep components parameter-driven.
- Avoid embedding navigation/state ownership unless it is part of the component’s contract.


## Examples

- `{examples.get('C_')}`
