# Pointers

Interaction helpers that steer users and trigger actions without owning business logic.

---
## Pointer responsibilities

Pointers are interaction helpers: navigation, selection, focus, and lightweight UI affordances.

Evidence:
- `Shared/_Core/03_Pointers/`
- `Shared/_Editor/03_Pointers/`


## Navigation helpers

- Keep pointers free of business logic.
- Prefer firing Actions (`A_`) rather than directly mutating shared state.


## Examples

- `{examples.get('P_')}`
