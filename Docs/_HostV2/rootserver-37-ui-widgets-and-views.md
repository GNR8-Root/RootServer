# Widgets and Views

How Widgets and Views differ and how they compose into screens.

---
## Widgets vs Views

- **Widgets**: higher-level containers and compositions (folder: `07_Widgets`).
- **Views**: layout definitions (folder: `08_View`).

Evidence:
- `Shared/_Core/07_Widgets/`, `Shared/_Core/08_View/`
- `Shared/_Editor/07_Widgets/`, `Shared/_Editor/08_View/`


## Composition patterns

- Use Widgets to package reusable “mini-screens”.
- Use Views to define layout and arrangement of components/widgets.


## Examples

- Widget example: `{examples.get('W_')}`
- View example: `{examples.get('V_')}`
