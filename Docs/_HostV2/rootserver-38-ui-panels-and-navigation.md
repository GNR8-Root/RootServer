# Panels and Navigation

Top-level shells and how navigation is expressed through Sites and Panels.

---
## Panels

Panels represent higher-level UI groupings (folder: `09_Panels`).

Evidence:
- `Shared/_Core/09_Panels/`
- `Shared/_Editor/09_Panels/`


## Navigation shells

Navigation is rooted in:
- `Shared/_Sites/Nav/`
- Panels that host multiple views



## Common layout patterns

- `PNL_` prefix indicates a panel component.

Example:
- `{examples.get('PNL_')}`
