# Nodes

Node/graph concepts in the codebase: what is present today and what is planned.

---
## Node system status

Node-related folders exist:
- `Shared/_Core/05_Nodes/`
- `Shared/_Editor/05_Nodes/`

This indicates node/graph capabilities are at least partially implemented.


## Current capabilities

Current capabilities must be confirmed by reviewing node types under the folders above.

Investigation steps:
- Enumerate node types and their ports/contracts.
- Identify where graphs are stored (JSON vs code).


## Planned capabilities

Planned capability: plugin ↔ plugin cooperation via a node system. Treat as experimental until verified.
